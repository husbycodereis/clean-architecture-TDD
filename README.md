# Clean architecture and TDD principals implementaion with BLoC state management



## Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is divided into three main layers.

Data ⇨ Local and / or Remote(API) data sources
Domain ⇨ business logic(use cases) and business objects(entities) to modify or shape the data source
Presentation ⇨ How modified data source is shown to user

These layers help build a Flutter application that is;

Easier to modify
Easier to test
Easier to detect bugs & errors


## Test Driven Development

The course has various methods to make unit tests for almost every use cases inside a Flutter application. However the BLoC state management tool testing methods are outdated and therefore it shouldn't be taken into account.

For further information about BLoC testing, the official documentation should be [studied](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/testing).
